ProbRules

1. System requirements
ProbRules is implemented in SWI-Prolog (v. 7.6.4), which offers a comprehensive free Prolog environment. SWI-Prolog is available for all major operating systems at http://www.swi-prolog.org. There is also an official docker image of SWI-Prolog at https://hub.docker.com/_/swipl.

2. Installation guide
Implementation of ProbRules is available in the file ProbRules.pl. For implementing own networks, this file has to be loaded via consult('ProbRules.pl').

3. Demo
For demo usage see implementation of network motifs and the Wnt-model supplied here. Expected output and runtime are available in folder output.
See also run_motifs.sh and run_wntmodel.sh for logging errors and time to folder output.

4. Instruction for use
Network files can be run via swipl -l filename.pl from a terminal.

The docker image can be used to run files via (see also Docker help):
a) Linux:
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd)/ProbRules:/ProbRules -w /ProbRules swipl filename.pl

b) Mac OS:
DIRNAME=`dirname "$0"`
docker run --rm -it -v $DIRNAME/ProbRules:/ProbRules -w /ProbRules swipl filename.pl

c) Windows:
docker-machine start
docker-machine env
@FOR /f "tokens=*" %%i IN ('docker-machine env') DO @%%i
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -command "docker run -v (($pwd -replace 'C', '/c' -replace ':', '' -replace '\\', '/')+'/ProbRules:/ProbRules') -w /ProbRules --rm -ti swipl filename.pl"
docker-machine stop
